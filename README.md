# MCDA5520 | Python Assignment
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Requirements

### Question 1

- Python does not support stack or queue by default. However, you can wrap the existing
list and available functions to imitate these data structures. This exercise is limited to
concepts we have learned in the workshop so far but you want to look up how to handle

### Question 2

- This exercise is to pratice applying a function to pandas dataframes. You will need to

### Question 3

- You will need to create a streamlit app that allows me to upload a CSV file with two
